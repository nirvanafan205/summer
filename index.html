            Welcome to my little website. During the spring semester, I was interview for Snapchat Engineering Academy
            for
            the summer. The prompt of the interview was to make
            a website for a business that we like. I am love Pokemon trading cards so it got me to wanting to make a
            website
            selling pokemon cards. I made a mock website for Fire and Dice
            trading card store. Altough I didn't move forward for the program, it got me really intrested in Front End
            development. So I started learning things in regard with Full stack Engineering.
            This led me to learn on my own through courses in Front End Masters and enrolling into a web engineering
            class
            for the summer time. So here is a website in regards of what I've
            learned in the summer for web engineering.

            This class consists of learning full stack development which include HTML/CSS for the front end, SQL for the
            database, and Node.js for the backend. Here is a list of things covered in the class
